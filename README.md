There are still some bugs about the class player, the score system and ai's alogrithm is too easy to get a pretty high score.
You need to enter the user name twice.
And you also need to download the libraries pygame,Tkinter, and PyuserInput using pip. 
Notice that you may need to change the routine of the sound file if you want the sound effect.
Tkinter API webpage:

Install Pip:
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

Install Pygame:
In command line, type pip install pygame to install pygame.
API page: https://www.pygame.org/docs/
If you get “error: command ‘/usr/bin/clang’ failed with exit status 1” then use the command pip install pygame==1.9.2 and that should fix it. If it doesn’t, you have to install Xcode and run xcode-select --install and download the Xcode tools

Install PyUserinput:
In command line, type pip install PyUserinput to install pygame.
If after import pykeyboard, there is a error called No module named win32api. pip install pypiwin32
